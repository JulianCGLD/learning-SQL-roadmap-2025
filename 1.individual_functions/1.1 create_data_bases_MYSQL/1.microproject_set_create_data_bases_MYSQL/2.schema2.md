CREATE DATABASE lang_support
CHARACTER SET utf8mb4  
COLLATE uf8mb4_unicode_ci;

What is character set
**Character set `utf8mb4`** is a Unicode character encoding in MySQL that supports **all Unicode characters**, including:
- Basic Latin (like ASCII)
- Extended Latin
- Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, etc.
- Emoji üòÄ
- CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean
- Rare and historical scripts (e.g., Gothic, Runic)

---
### üîß Why use `utf8mb4` instead of `utf8`?

- MySQL‚Äôs `utf8` **only supports up to 3 bytes per character**, which **doesn't cover all Unicode characters** (e.g., emojis or some Asian characters).
- `utf8mb4` stands for **UTF-8 Most Bytes 4**, which allows **all** Unicode characters by supporting **up to 4 bytes per character**.
- It's now considered the **correct UTF-8 implementation** in MySQL.

### üî§ What is `COLLATE` in MySQL?

**`COLLATE`** (short for **collation**) defines the **rules MySQL uses to compare and sort text** (i.e., string data) stored in a given character set.

---
### üß© Breakdown:

- **Character Set** = _What symbols/letters can be stored_
    
- **Collation** = _How those symbols are compared/sorted_
    

---

### üìö Example:

Let‚Äôs say you store the letters:

```sql
'a', 'A', '√°', '√Å'
```

Depending on the collation, these might be treated as **equal** (case-insensitive, accent-insensitive) or **different** (case-sensitive, accent-sensitive).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Types of Collation Behavior:

|Type|Case Sensitive?|Accent Sensitive?|
|---|---|---|
|`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|
|`utf8mb4_general_ci`|‚ùå No|‚ùå No|
|`utf8mb4_bin`|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|

> `ci` = case-insensitive  
> `bin` = binary (strict)

---

### üîç Example Usage:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE lang_support
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

This means:

- Store all Unicode characters (thanks to `utf8mb4`)
    
- Sort and compare strings **without caring about case or accents**
    

---

### üß™ Example behavior:

If you query:

```sql
SELECT '√Å' = 'a';
```

- With `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, this might return `TRUE` (collation ignores case and accent)
    
- With `utf8mb4_bin`, it would return `FALSE` (compares exact binary bytes)
    

---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

- **`COLLATE`** controls how MySQL **compares and sorts** text.
    
- It works **with** a character set to define string behavior.
    
- Choose the right collation based on whether your app needs **case sensitivity**, **accent sensitivity**, or **binary exactness**.
