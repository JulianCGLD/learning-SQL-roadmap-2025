CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS reporting_db; 
what is IF NOT EXIST in MySQL?
The "IF NOT EXISTS" clause in the MySQL "CREATE DATABASE" statement is used to prevent an error from occurring if the database you are trying to create already exists. When you include "IF NOT EXISTS," MySQL will check if a database with the specified name already exists. If it does, the command will not create a new database and will not return an error; instead, it will simply do nothing. If the database does not exist, it will create it as intended.
